# Complex-Calculator-Using-PYTHON


## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that implements a complex calculator capable of performing various mathematical operations. The calculator can handle basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more. It provides an interactive command-line interface where users can select the operation they wish to perform.

## Features

- *Basic Arithmetic Operations*: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- *Advanced Mathematical Functions*:
  - Power
  - Square Root
  - Logarithm (with customizable base)
  - Trigonometric Functions (Sine, Cosine, Tangent)
  - Factorial
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Simple prompts for user inputs with validation.
- *Looping Mechanism*: Allows continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The script is compatible with Python 3.x.

## Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/complex-calculator-using-python.git

   cd complex-calculator-using-python
   python complex_calculator.py


   Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Power
6. Square Root
7. Logarithm
8. Sine
9. Cosine
10. Tangent
11. Factorial
Enter choice (1-11): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
The result is: 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes

Exactly like that interface that has been above shown........
